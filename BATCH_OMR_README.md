## 🎯 OMR Sheet Requirements

### For Best Results:
1. **Clear Images**: High contrast, well-lit photographs
2. **Proper Alignment**: Sheets should be reasonably straight
3. **Bubble Marking**: Use dark pen/pencil, fill bubbles completely
4. **Text Areas**: Write names and roll numbers clearly in designated areas
5. **Image Quality**: Minimum 300 DPI recommended

### Supported Formats:
- JPG/JPEG

## 🔍 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues:

#### OCR Not Detecting Names/Roll Numbers
- Ensure text is written clearly in the top portion of the sheet
- Use dark ink/pencil
- Avoid cursive handwriting when possible
- Check image quality and lighting

#### Bubble Detection Issues
- Verify bubbles are completely filled
- Ensure good contrast between marked and unmarked bubbles
- Check image alignment and quality
- Adjust threshold parameters if needed

#### Processing Errors
- Check image file formats and sizes
- Ensure sufficient system memory for batch processing
- Verify all dependencies are installed correctly

### Performance Tips:
- Process images in smaller batches (50-100 at a time) for better performance
- Use high-quality, well-lit images
- Ensure consistent OMR sheet layout across all students
